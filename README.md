# Reconscanner

A Python-based network scanning tool that automates various **Nmap scans** for network reconnaissance and security analysis.
This project demonstrates fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting, and vulnerability discovery.

## Features

* Multiple scan types using Nmap:

  * SYN Scan
  * UDP Scan
  * Comprehensive Scan
  * OS Detection
  * Version Detection
  * Aggressive Scan
* Automated scanning using Python
* Interactive CLI interface
* Displays open ports and protocols
* Banner output using `pyfiglet`
* Colored terminal output using `termcolor`

## Usage

Run the tool:

```bash
python Networkscanner.py
```

Enter the target IP address and select the scan type:

```text
1. SYN ACK Scan
2. UDP Scan
3. Comprehensive Scan
```

## Scan Types Explained

| Scan Type          | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SYN Scan           | Fast and stealthy scan to detect open ports       |
| UDP Scan           | Detects UDP services                              |
| Comprehensive Scan | Includes version detection, scripts, OS detection |
| OS Detection       | Identifies operating system                       |
| Version Detection  | Detects service versions                          |
| Aggressive Scan    | Combines multiple scan techniques                 |
